What is SOC Compass
-----------------
SOC Compass is the new way of delivering Security Operation Center (SOC) assessments. Instead of recording static and brittle maturity scores in Excel workbooks that only capture a snapshot in time, Compass provides a workbench-style approach that enables continous tracking of a SOCs maturity level, enabling you to react on strategic objectives as your SOC evolves.

Whilst frameworks exist, they tend to fall short by not providing specific actions, timelines and recommendations that a SOC manager can follow through with.

Compass enables new SOC Managers and Consultants by providing specific recommendations, action plans and timelines, guiding you through how to execute upon delivering an effective SOC that meets your organisations needs.

Compass captures key context such as:

- SOC budget
- SOC Age
- SOC Industry
- Your Objectives with the Assessment i.e. improve detection, identify efficiencies etc.

With this context captured - utilising AI (Bring your own Key) - Compass provides three key utilities to drive immediate value:

**Compass Copilot** - As you enter evidence and maturity information, you can ask Copilot about this information, almost like a "SOC Manager on-demand with 10 years experience" to ask questions.

**Compass Recommends** - As you complete aspects of your assessment, automation triggers a Compass Recommends workflow which reviews your submitted answers and evidence, providing an immediate summary with high-level recommendations of how to improve that particular aspect. This saves you having to complete an entire assessment, if you only have a few short-term focus areas.

**Compass Reporter** - Our most complete AI offering, our reporting agent will review your entire assessment (if completed 80%+) and provide a complete report with a high-level summary, quick wins and a detailed action plan and timeline. Each action and recommendation not only integrates with the existing guidance found in SOC-CMM, for example, but also ensures the actions generated fit within your initial context i.e. budget, SOC age, objectives etc.
