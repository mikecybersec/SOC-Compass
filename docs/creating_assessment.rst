How to manage your workspaces
-----------------
As of the latest version, you can:

- Rename a workspace
- Delete a workspace

**Renaming a Workspace**
From the homepage of the app, click on "Platform" and then hover your cursor over the tile for the workspace you intend to rename. You will see a pencil icon next to the title, change your workspace name here. Note that multiple workspaces are allowed to have the same name and workspace titles are limited to a maximum of 20 characters (alphanumeric & hyphens only)

**Deleting a Workspace**
It is important to note that if you delete a workspace, all assessments will also be deleted.

To delete a workspace, from the homepage of the app click on "Platform" and then hover your cursor over the tile for the workspace you intend to delete. A settings cog icon will appear, click this and you will see a delete workspace button. You must enter the workspace name and tick a box to confirm you're sure that you would like to delete the workspace and acknowledge you will lose all assessment progress as part of that assessment.
