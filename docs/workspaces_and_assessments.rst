Workspaces & Assessments
===============

SOC Compass organises assessments into a workspace. A workspace can logically store multiple assessments together. This is useful if you perform assessments for multiple organisations and would like to seperate them, or if you'd like to perform a "light" assessment at one point and a more in-depth one later.

-----------------
Creating your first workspace
-----------------
To create your first workspace, click on "Platform" in the navigation bar, then click "New Workspace".

This will open a modal with a form to enter a name for the workspace. Once you have entered a name, you will be guided through the key inputs to creating your first assessment too. The following inputs will be captured by the creation wizard:

- SOC Budget
- SOC Age
- Industry/Sector
- Strategic Objectives
- Type of Assessment e.g. SOC-CMM, SIM3, MITRE Inform

By capturing this context, Compass Copilot and Compass Recommendations (AI) will provide specific and grounded recommendations that fit your; budget, maturity, objectives and typical industry trends.

Once your workspace and assessment are created, you will be redirected to the assessment page to begin.

Managing Workspaces
-----------------
As of the latest version, you can:

- Rename a workspace
- Delete a workspace

**Renaming a Workspace**
From the homepage of the app, click on "Platform" and then hover your cursor over the tile for the workspace you intend to rename. You will see a pencil icon next to the title, change your workspace name here. Note that multiple workspaces are allowed to have the same name and workspace titles are limited to a maximum of 20 characters (alphanumeric & hyphens only)

**Deleting a Workspace**
It is important to note that if you delete a workspace, all assessments will also be deleted.

To delete a workspace, from the homepage of the app click on "Platform" and then hover your cursor over the tile for the workspace you intend to delete. A settings cog icon will appear, click this and you will see a delete workspace button. You must enter the workspace name and tick a box to confirm you're sure that you would like to delete the workspace and acknowledge you will lose all assessment progress as part of that assessment.

**Switching a Workspace**
You might want to switch between workspaces to work on different assessments you have organised. When inside an existing workspace, you can use the assessment switcher in the top left, click the workspace name in the top left and a list of other assessments will dropdown, click "Switch Workspace". Alternatively, go to "Platform" from the homepage and click a workspace to enter it.

Assessment Modes

Compass offers 3 different experiences for completing and delivering your assessment:

- Solo - Compass will not assist you with analysing SOPs, documentation and initial evidence as you create the assessment.
- Guided (Coming Soon) - Compass will initially take a submission of files as evidence. Utilising underlying functionality and AI, Compass will analyse the files and data to complete relevant assessment aspects for you, speeding up the process.
- Continous (Coming Soon) - Compass will connect directly into your SOC documentation platform, such as Confluence. Compass will fetch the evidence it sees fit for the assessment and complete relevant assessment aspects for you. This is ideal for tracking changes in your SOC operating model.
