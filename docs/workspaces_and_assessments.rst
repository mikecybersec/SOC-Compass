Workspaces & Assessments
===============

SOC Compass organises assessments into a workspace. A workspace can logically store multiple assessments together. This is useful if you perform assessments for multiple organisations and would like to seperate them, or if you'd like to perform a "light" assessment at one point and a more in-depth one later.

-----------------
Creating your first workspace
-----------------
To create your first workspace, click on "Platform" in the navigation bar, then click "New Workspace".

This will open a modal with a form to enter a name for the workspace. Once you have entered a name, you will be guided through the key inputs to creating your first assessment too. The following inputs will be captured by the creation wizard:

- SOC Budget
- SOC Age
- Industry/Sector
- Strategic Objectives
- Type of Assessment e.g. SOC-CMM, SIM3, MITRE Inform

By capturing this context, Compass Copilot and Compass Recommendations (AI) will provide specific and grounded recommendations that fit your; budget, maturity, objectives and typical industry trends.

 Once your workspace and assessment are created, you will be redirected to the assessment page to begin.
