Compass AI Features
===================

SOC Compass leverages artificial intelligence to provide intelligent guidance, recommendations, and comprehensive reporting throughout your assessment journey. All AI features utilise your own API key (Bring Your Own Key), ensuring data privacy and giving you full control over AI usage and costs.

The AI is context-aware, tailoring all outputs based on your captured SOC context including budget, SOC age, industry sector, and strategic objectives. This ensures recommendations are practical, achievable, and aligned with your organisation's specific circumstances.

-----------------
Compass Copilot
-----------------

Compass Copilot provides an interactive, conversational AI assistant that acts as your on-demand SOC management advisor. As you progress through your assessment, entering evidence and maturity information, Copilot becomes familiar with your specific SOC context and assessment data.

**How It Works**

Copilot is available throughout your assessment journey. Simply ask questions in natural language about:

- Your assessment progress and maturity scores
- Evidence you've submitted and its implications
- Best practices for specific SOC capabilities
- How to improve particular areas of your SOC
- Interpretation of framework requirements
- Strategic guidance on SOC development

**Key Features**

- **Context-Aware Responses** - Copilot understands your SOC's budget, age, industry, and objectives, providing tailored advice rather than generic guidance
- **Assessment-Aware** - The AI has access to your submitted evidence and maturity information, enabling it to provide specific, relevant recommendations
- **Framework Knowledge** - Deep understanding of SOC-CMM, SIM3, and MITRE Inform frameworks
- **Conversational Interface** - Ask follow-up questions and refine your understanding through natural dialogue

**Use Cases**

- "What evidence should I provide for threat intelligence capability?"
- "How does my current maturity score compare to similar SOCs in my industry?"
- "What are the quickest wins I can achieve with my current budget?"
- "Explain the difference between Level 2 and Level 3 for incident response"

**Outcomes**

SOC managers gain immediate access to expert-level guidance without waiting for consultant availability, enabling faster decision-making and more informed assessment completion.

-----------------
Compass Recommends
-----------------

Compass Recommends provides immediate, actionable feedback as you complete specific aspects of your assessment. This feature automatically triggers when you finish answering questions and submitting evidence for a particular capability or domain.

**How It Works**

After completing a section of your assessment (for example, a specific capability within a domain), Compass Recommends automatically analyses your submitted answers and evidence. It then generates:

- **Immediate Summary** - A concise overview of your current maturity level for that aspect
- **High-Level Recommendations** - Specific, actionable suggestions for improvement
- **Contextual Guidance** - Recommendations that align with your SOC's budget, age, and objectives

**Key Features**

- **Automated Triggering** - No manual action required; recommendations appear automatically upon section completion
- **Focused Feedback** - Provides targeted guidance on specific areas without requiring full assessment completion
- **Immediate Value** - Get actionable insights even if you're only focusing on a few short-term improvement areas
- **Contextual Relevance** - All recommendations consider your organisation's specific constraints and objectives

**Use Cases**

- Complete the "Threat Intelligence" capability section and receive immediate recommendations on improving your threat intelligence programme
- Finish answering questions about "Incident Response" and get specific guidance on enhancing your IR processes
- Submit evidence for "Security Monitoring" and receive tailored suggestions based on your current maturity level

**Outcomes**

SOC managers can identify and act on improvement opportunities immediately, without waiting to complete the entire assessment. This enables rapid iteration and continuous improvement, particularly valuable when focusing on specific short-term objectives or addressing critical gaps.

-----------------
Compass Reporter
-----------------

Compass Reporter is the most comprehensive AI offering, providing a complete, professional assessment report with strategic insights, actionable recommendations, and detailed implementation timelines.

**How It Works**

Once your assessment reaches 80% completion, Compass Reporter becomes available. The AI agent performs a comprehensive review of your entire assessment, analysing:

- All submitted evidence and maturity scores across all domains
- Your captured SOC context (budget, age, industry, objectives)
- Framework requirements and best practices
- Relationships between different capabilities and domains

The reporter then generates a complete document including:

- **Executive Summary** - High-level overview of your SOC's current state and key findings
- **Quick Wins** - Immediate, low-effort improvements that deliver significant value
- **Detailed Action Plan** - Specific, prioritised actions with clear descriptions
- **Implementation Timeline** - Realistic timelines for each action, considering your budget and SOC maturity
- **Strategic Recommendations** - Long-term guidance aligned with your objectives

**Key Features**

- **Comprehensive Analysis** - Reviews your entire assessment holistically, identifying patterns and relationships
- **Framework Integration** - All recommendations integrate with existing framework guidance (e.g., SOC-CMM) whilst ensuring actions fit your specific context
- **Prioritised Actions** - Actions are ordered by impact and feasibility, helping you focus on what matters most
- **Budget-Conscious** - Recommendations are tailored to your available budget, avoiding suggestions that are financially unrealistic
- **Maturity-Appropriate** - Guidance accounts for your SOC's current age and maturity level, providing achievable next steps

**Requirements**

- Assessment must be at least 80% complete
- Requires your own AI API key (BYOK model)
- Generates a comprehensive report suitable for executive presentation

**Outcomes**

SOC managers receive a professional, publication-ready assessment report that can be shared with stakeholders, used for strategic planning, and serve as a roadmap for SOC improvement. The report provides both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic guidance, all tailored to your organisation's specific circumstances.

**Report Structure**

The generated report typically includes:

1. **Executive Summary** - Key findings and overall maturity assessment
2. **Current State Analysis** - Detailed breakdown of capabilities and maturity levels
3. **Quick Wins** - Immediate improvements with high impact
4. **Action Plan** - Prioritised list of specific actions with descriptions
5. **Implementation Roadmap** - Timeline and sequencing of recommended actions
6. **Strategic Recommendations** - Long-term guidance aligned with your objectives
